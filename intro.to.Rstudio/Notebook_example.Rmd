This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 



```{r First chunck}
plot(cars)
2+2
db <- c("foo","bar")
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

```{r}
# You can still comment inside blocks of code: 
# and you can load libraries
library(ggplot2)

quickplot(cars$speed,cars$dist) +
  coord_flip()+
  theme_minimal()
```


# Header  
That was a large header 

## Subheader  
That header wasn't so large 

### Subsubheader  
Now it's getting even smaller  
 
Write something in *italics* and in **bold**

### Here is a fancy plot  

```{r}
# load package and data
library(ggplot2)
data(mpg, package="ggplot2")
# mpg <- read.csv("http://goo.gl/uEeRGu")

mpg_select <- mpg[mpg$manufacturer %in% c("audi", "ford", "honda", "hyundai"), ]

# Scatterplot
theme_set(theme_bw())  # pre-set the bw theme.
g <- ggplot(mpg_select, aes(displ, cty)) + 
  labs(subtitle="mpg: Displacement vs City Mileage",
       title="Bubble chart")

g + geom_jitter(aes(col=manufacturer, size=hwy)) + 
  geom_smooth(aes(col=manufacturer), method="lm", se=F)
```
